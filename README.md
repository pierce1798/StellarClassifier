# StellarClassifier

This project was created to explore classification models to classify stellar objects.

  - It first includes imports and feature descriptions followed by two fucntions Created to get different model quickly
  - Next the data was explored, and X and y were specified, and a dummy model was created
  - Now different models were created to see the performance of each one
  - I then created more models after changing the data and the Data Frame to see how scores would change
  - I found that the Random Forest model performed the best
  - I then used code from flatiron to save time and quickly run a grid search on the models parameters
  - Finally visualization model were created for the presentation
